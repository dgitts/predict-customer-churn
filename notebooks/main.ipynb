    "# Predict Customer Churn\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer churn is the percentage of customers that stop using a company service or product during a time period.\n",
    "To calculate the churn rate, divide the number of customers the business lost during a time period by the number of customers the business had at the beginning of that time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer churn rate is an important metric for any business to evaluate because it costs more to acquire new customers than it does to retain existing ones. Returning customers are likely to spend more on various company products and services because they do not need convincing to become a customer. This reduces operating expenses for a business since they do not need to spend as much resources acquiring this business.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, a bank would like to identify customer characteristics for customers who are likely to stop using their credit card services. By identifying this KPI, the bank can quickly identify what features greatly affect customer retention and begin targetting these features to minimize churn rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we aim to aleviate costs that businesses accrue do to loss of customers, by prediction best customer retention features."
    "\n"
    "We will do this by analyzing each feature against the target column to determine what features have the strongest impact on the target."
    "\n"
    "The data is structured into several data points that the bank tracks for each customer. We will only use a single dataset for this project.\n",
    "## Data Acquisition\n",
    "We obtained this dataset from [LEAPS](https://leapsapp.analyttica.com/cases/11).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 10,127 records. There are 20 features and 1 target (Attrition Flag).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is structured and we will use supervised learning models to make the predictions.\n",
